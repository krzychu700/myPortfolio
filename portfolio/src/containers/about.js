            I am graduate University of Warmia and Mazury in Olsztyn, currently
            working as Navigation Information Analyst in aviation company. I am
            open to propositions and always strive to acquire new knowledge and
            experience. I like to learn new things and always looking for new
            challenges, thatâ€™s why I decided, to take the first steps as Junior
            Front-end Developer. In February 2019 I finished 720h of the course
            realized by Kodilla. Currently I am working on my own projects,
            trying to improve my skills and practice knowledge, which I learned.
